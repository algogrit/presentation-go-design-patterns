## As an instructor

- I promise to

  - make this class as interactive as possible

  - use as many resources as available to keep you engaged

  - ensure everyone's questions are addressed

---

## What I need from you

- Be vocal

  - Let me know if there any audio/video issues ASAP

  - Feel free to interrupt me and ask me questions

- Be punctual

- Give feedback

- Work on the exercises

- Be *on mute* unless you are speaking

## Class Progression

---
class: center, middle

Here you are trying to *learn* something, while here your *brain* is doing you a favor by making sure the learning doesn't stick!

### Some tips

- Slow down => stop & think
  listen for the questions and answer

- Do the exercises
  not add-ons; not optional

- There are no dumb questions!

- Drink water. Lots of it!

---

### Some tips (continued)

- Take notes
  Refer to the them for a few days

- Talk about it out loud

- Listen to your brain

- Design something

## Before we dive into patterns

---

- Methods, interfaces and inheritance

- **SOLID** principles

---
class: center, middle

### Methods, interfaces and inheritance

---
class: center, middle

#### Methods

---
class: center, middle

Methods are known as receivers or receiver functions in Go

---

- Receivers can be defined on any user-defined type in Go

- You can define multiple receivers with same name but on different receiver types, within a package

- They need to be defined in the same package as the `type` is defined in

- Getters & Setters are anti-patterns in Go

- Two kinds of receiver functions: *value* receivers & *pointer* receivers

---

##### Value receivers

- `func (<varName> <receiverType>) <funcNameA>() { ... }`
  - Eg. `func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 { ... }`

---
class: center, middle

There is no `this` or `self` keyword in go, which could give you a hold of the variable on which you are dispatching a receiver.

---
class: center, middle

They are instead passed in to the receiver, the same way you have arguments to a function.

---

##### Pointer receivers

- `func (<varName> *<receiverType>) <funcNameB>() { ... }`
  - Eg. `func (v *Vertex) Scale(by float64) { ... }`

---

Pointer receivers can help in:

- Avoiding copy of a large-ish struct variable

- Update fields of a struct variable

- Useful for dispatching even on `nil` values

---

The value & pointer receivers can be dispatched interchangeably:

- `var v <receiverType>`
  - `v.funcNameA()` & `v.funcNameB()`

- `p := &v`
  - `p.funcNameA()` & `p.funcNameB()`

#### Interfaces

---
class: center, middle

Interfaces are implicit in Go!

---

- `interface` keyword

- `type Foo interface { ... }`

- It contains only method definitions

---

##### Rules

1. If any type implements all of the methods required by the interface, only then it implicitly implements the interface

2. if a value type implements an interface, then the pointer to the value type also implements the interface

3. If any of the receiver methods, required by interface `I` on type `A` are pointer receiver, then only `*A` will be implementing an interface

---

```go
type I interface {
  Foo()
  Bar()
}

type A struct{}

func (a *A) Foo() {}

func (a A) Bar() {}
```

then,

```go
var i I

// i = A{} // Will result in compiler error

i = &A{}
```

#### Inheritance

---
class: center, middle

go has inheritance through *composition*!

---
class: center, middle

##### Struct "inheritance"

---
class: center, middle

A struct type can compose or "embed" another type

---

```go
type Bar string

func (b Bar) bar() {}

type Foo struct {
  Bar
  // Bar Bar
}
```

---

- Here the custom type `Foo` "inherits" Bar's bar method

- If a struct composes a struct, it can also "inherit" Fields

---
class: center, middle

Multiple inheritance is possible and easy to deal with

---
class: center, middle

##### Interface "inheritance"

---
class: center, middle

An interface can compose another interface
